##Local Restaurant Finder


### Objective 
  When I worked on the overnight shift, I often struggled to find places open for business at 1am. Being the adventurous foodie I am,
  a rotation of McDonalds, Burger King and Wendy's wouldn't suffice. When I only had an hour to find a place, drive there, order food
  then bring it back and eat it, time was of the essence. Enter Local Restaurant Finder. 
  
  Local Restaurant Finder is all about simplicity -- Three essential options (Coffee, Pizza or Tacos), automatic geo-locating, and venue
  ratings all placed conveniently in google maps. The best part? It only displays venues that are currently open. 
  
  
### Technologies Used
 
 1. HTML
 2. CSS
 3. Bootstrap (Responsive Design) 
 4. Javascript
 5. Knockout JS (MVVM) 
 6. jQuery (keep coffee default option, responsiveness for list view)
 
 
 ### How To Use 

1. Make sure you have location settings on in your browser
2. Navigate [here](https://quesurfin.github.io/neighborhood-app/)
3. By default coffee will load, if you do not want coffee, pick another option
4. Order food!
